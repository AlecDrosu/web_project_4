**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. (After sprint 9), the JavaScript was much much more complicated and I had to discuss the project in great detail to understand everything. However, it does work very well, and keeping the code seperated and invlolving webpack has made it much easier to work with. **After Review 3** I can now receive the id from the server. Right now I set the id, and just call 
userInfo.getUserInfo._id inside the card class. I chose to do this as I figured it is cleaner, instead of creating something like let cardId = null, and modify the value inside the first promise. This method would also work though.
