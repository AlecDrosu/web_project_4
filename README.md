# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. (After sprint 6), the JavaScript was more complicated but it works well. I can't find any problems besides maybe color discrepencies, but those would be easy to fix.
