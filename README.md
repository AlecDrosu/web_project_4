# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. (After sprint 9), the JavaScript was much much more complicated and I had to discuss the project in great detail to understand everything. However, it does work very well, and keeping the code seperated and invlolving webpack has made it much easier to work with. **After Review 2**, Everything works now. I honestly think that everything is fixed, there were some problems that were quite interesting to fix, like how the delete card popup needed to be completly changed to work. Also how the card list needed to be reversed in order to show the cards properly. The project took a while, but was fun. If there is any other issue please let me know :)
