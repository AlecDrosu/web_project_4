### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. (After sprint 6), the JavaScript was more complicated but it works well. I can't find any problems besides maybe color discrepencies, but those would be easy to fix. Overall the JavaScript was very frustrating, but was als very fun :)

**Changes After Review 1**:

I made changes so that the form starting state is invalid, and the user won't be able to submit anything without the proper inputs. I also made changes to all the other problems so everything should be in order now. I have not made changes to everything that could be improved but I will be working on those.
