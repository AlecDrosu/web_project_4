# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. It went quite smoothly with little serious problems. Something I did have trouble with though was Git. 
I created a develop branch but forgot to create feature branches in the develop branch. Because of this I just merged everything in
develop into main. This does not cause any problems since no one else
is working on this project, however I will make sure to use feature branches in the future. I am having some trouble with how to determine if the popup is open or not. I tried several things like determining if the style was display = 'flex', but this did not work. I instead make a condition where if the boxes are empty then they should be filled with the name. I am going to try to find out if there is a way to just add the content when a user clicks on the edit box.
