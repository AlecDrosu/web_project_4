# Project 4: Around The U.S.

### Overview

* Figma
* Images

**Figma**

* [Link to the project in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/SurN1jaeEQIhuZEDMhmWWf/Sprint-4-Around-The-U.S.-desktop-mobile?node-id=0%3A1)

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. It went quite smoothly with little serious problems. Something I did have trouble with though was Git. 
I created a develop branch but forgot to create feature branches in the develop branch. Because of this I just merged everything in
develop into main. This does not cause any problems since no one else
is working on this project, however I will make sure to use feature branches in the future.
