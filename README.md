**Figma**

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!

This is the finished product. (After sprint 9), the JavaScript was much much more complicated and I had to discuss the project in great detail to understand everything. However, it does work very well, and keeping the code seperated and invlolving webpack has made it much easier to work with. **After Review 1**, I made a bunch of changes, I should be almost done. There is still a slight problem with the renderLoading function, which I am working on. The largest problem is getting the deletePopup to work properly, for some reason I cannot call any method while the deleteCardApi is inside of renderFunction, so even if my renderLoading function works, it doesn't ever get called. I have no idea why it does not work inside renderCard, yet works perfectly outside it. I reached out to my mentor but have not received a response back yet.

With all these problems however, everything else is working smoothly, so I am submitting for my second review to see if I am making any issues with deleting the card, that is causing it to not work properly. As well as to see if all my corrections to everything else are correct.
